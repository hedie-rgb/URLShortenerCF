## How to work with the project

You can use the instructions on [this](https://www.quackit.com/coldfusion/tutorial/coldfusion_installation.cfm) website to install Coldfusion.

### Install Lucee

To run the project locally, you need to download and install your appropriate Lucee installer using [this](https://download.lucee.org/) website.

### IDE

I used VSCode as an IDE. VSCode has an extension to build and run Coldfusion projects. You can install and find more about this extension [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=com-adobe-coldfusion.adobe-cfml-lsp).
